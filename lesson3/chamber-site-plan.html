        <h2>Scenario 1 - Event Information</h2>
        <h3>Visitor Persona: Local Resident Interested in Chamber Events</h3>
        <p>
            Question: "I'm a local resident and heard about upcoming events organized by the Snowflake Chamber of
            Commerce. Where can I find information about these events, including dates, venues, and registration
            details?"</p>
        <!-- #2 -->
        <h2>Scenario 2 - Contacting the Board of Directors</h2>
        <h3>Visitor Persona: Community Member Interested in Chamber Leadership</h3>
        <p>Question: "Where can I find contact information for the chamber's board of directors?"

            In this case, the website should have a clear and accessible directory of the board of directors, including
            names, positions, email addresses, and perhaps short bios. This information should be available on the
            Directory page or in an About Us section.</p>
        <!-- #3 -->
        <h2>Scenario 3 - Area Population Growth</h2>
        <h3>Visitor Persona: Prospective Resident or Business Investor</h3>
        <p>Question: "What has been the population growth in the Snowflake area?"

            To address this inquiry, the Discover page should contain information about the town's demographics,
            historical population data, and trends. Visual aids like charts or graphs could help illustrate this data
            effectively.</p>
