        <h1>White Space and Clean Design:</h1>
        <h3>Organization/Company: Apple</h3>
        <h3>Website: Apple</h3>
        <img src="./images/apple.png" alt="apple">
        <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/">apple.com</a></h3>

        <p>Description: Apple's website is a prime example of clean and minimalistic design with ample white space. The
            homepage features a simple layout with high-quality product images and concise text. The use of white space
            allows the products to stand out, creating a visually pleasing and clutter-free browsing experience.</p>

        <h1>Visual Hierarchy:</h1>
        <h3>Organization/Company: Google</h3>
            <h3>Website: Google</h3>

            <img src="./images/google.png" alt="google">
            <h3><a href="https://www.google.com/">google.com</a></h3>

            <p>Description: Google's homepage exemplifies visual hierarchy through its minimalist and focused design.
                The
                most prominent element on the page is the search bar, which is large and centered. This immediately
                draws
                the user's attention and signifies that the primary action on the page is to perform a search. The
                Google
                logo, although colorful, is visually subordinate to the search bar, reinforcing the importance of
                search.

                    while keeping the user experience relatively simple and intuitive. The homepage presents users with
